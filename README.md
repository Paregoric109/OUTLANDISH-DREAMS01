# OUTLANDISH-DREAMS01
To be, or not to be--that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep-- No more--and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep-- To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life.
Yes... To Dream, to dream of a beautiful world, a world where all Men, Women, and children are truly created equal. This is the final frontier the frontier of the OUTLANDER! The person who does not belong, who does not understand the culture into which they have been thrust. This person, and those with a common lack of understanding of the necesity that the Evil Empire force upon the masses, will be the chosen one. We are indoctrinated from birth to accept various precepts involving what our perception of Happiness should be... The OUTLANDER will change all of this; With a Fresh Perspective, a wild heart and an unmarred soul. Sometimes we can not fix a problem, because we are too close to it.
